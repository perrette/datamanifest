# `datamanifest` — Python implementation notes

This page documents how the **Python** `datamanifest` package behaves. The
`datamanifest.toml` *format* it reads and writes is not defined here: the
normative, language-independent spec lives in its own repository so neither
implementation owns it, and [`DataManifest.jl`](https://github.com/awi-esc/DataManifest.jl)
(Julia) reads and writes the same files.

## Conformance

This package conforms to **schema v1** (`_META.schema = 1`) against spec tag
**`spec-v3.6`**. The two version axes are independent: `_META.schema` is the
data-model version (bumped only on breaking structural change), and the spec tag
tracks prose/fixture evolution. Pinning the tag here is what lets this package and
`DataManifest.jl` move at their own pace while sharing one normative format.

**Pinned spec:** https://github.com/perrette/datamanifest.toml/blob/spec-v3.6/SCHEMA.md

> **Note:** The conformance fixture tarball still points at `spec-v1.1`. Re-pinning
> the fixture suite to the `spec-v3.6` git tag requires a network fetch and is a manual
> post-merge step; the offline test suite runs against the already-downloaded fixtures.

The whole *contract* two implementations must agree on — top-level layout, common
fields, `_LANG` bindings and `$var` substitution, the fetch/load ladders, the
storage model (folder variables, `$`-selectors, path-expression interpolation,
`repo→data→cache` read order, `.complete` markers), and canonical byte-identity
ordering — is normative *in the spec*, not restated here. When this page and the
spec disagree, the spec wins.

The spec is capability-based: a tool declares which named capabilities it supports
and runs only the fixtures tagged for them. This package's status:

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `lang-read` | ✅ | Parses `[<ds>._LANG.python]` / `[_LANG.python.loaders]` **and** the language-implicit ("bare") forms — a per-dataset `fetcher`/`loader` and the top-level `[_LOADERS]` format→binding map, read as Python (spec-v3.4) — then applies the fetch/load ladders. An explicit `_LANG.python` binding wins over the bare one; a binding present for the running language (bare or explicit) that fails is an error — fail-loud, no silent fall-through (spec-v3.6). |
| `lang-write` | ✅ | Regenerates `_LANG.python` only from explicit bindings, keeps bare `fetcher`/`loader`/`shell` and `[_LOADERS]` **bare** (never promoted into `_LANG.python`), and preserves foreign `_LANG.*` + unknown `_*` tables verbatim (lossless round-trip). |
| `shell-fetch` | ✅ | Executes the dataset's bare `shell` command template (spec-v3.5 canonical, language-agnostic), else the legacy `[<ds>._LANG.shell].fetcher` (`expand_shell_template`). |
| `storage` | ✅ | spec-v3 storage model: **bare roots** (`$data`/`$cache` resolve to `platformdirs` dirs without `/Datasets` suffix; `$repo` = project root); content composed as `<root>/datasets/<key>` (fetch) or `<root>/cached/<project-id>/<cachetype>/[<version>/]<hash>` (produced); `DATAMANIFEST_DIR` application base; folder variables (`$data`, `$cache`, `$repo` built-in; user-defined via `[_STORAGE]`), `$folder[/subpath]` selectors, `[_STORAGE].default` project default, path-expression interpolation, env-var/`_HOST` precedence ladder (no `_PROFILE` rung), `repo→data→cache` built-in probe order under `datasets/` prefix, atomic publish + `.complete` markers. Bare (non-`$`) `store` values are rejected with a migration hint. |
| `byte-identity` | ✅ | Canonical lexicographic key ordering; this package is the **normative reference** (`sort_recursive` in the `datamanifest.store` substrate). |
| `binding-args` | ✅ | Executes the `{ ref, args, kwargs }` table form with `$var` substitution (`_substitute_vars`). |
| `cache-produce` | ✅ | Produce-or-load: the `@cached` decorator with canonical-JSON→SHA-256 param-hash keying, `cachetype` defaulting to the function's qualified name (with load-time `(cachetype, version)` conflict detection), optional `version=` segment (path + `config.toml` entry, not in hash), `config.toml`/`metadata.toml` sidecars; spec-v3 artifact path `<cache>/cached/<project-id>/<cachetype>/[<version>/]<hash>`. See [Produce-or-load cache layer](#produce-or-load-cache-layer) and [design notes](design-notes.md). |
| `inspect` | ✅ | The `cached.toml` produced-dataset index (schema 2: nested `[[produced]]` recipes keyed by `(scope, cachetype, version)`, each with per-variation `[[produced.instances]]` recording `hash` + `params`) and the `datamanifest list` maintenance surface: `--kind`/`--scope`/`--orphan`/`--older-than`/`--format`/`--fields` filters + `--delete`/`--move` actions (dry run by default; `--yes` to apply). The default `list` view is nested (recipe → its parameter variations); `--bare` is one name per recipe. `last-access` is read-derived from the filesystem access time at inspect time — never written on read (best-effort, advisory). |
| `sync` | ✅ | Cross-machine `push`/`pull` of a stored object over rsync+ssh (`datamanifest push/pull <id> <ssh-host>`, plus bulk `list --push/--pull <host>`), addressed by its machine-independent id (fetched by `name`/`alias`/`doi`; produced by `cachetype[/version]/hash`, full or an unambiguous hash prefix). The remote store root is resolved best-effort from the remote env (`ssh <host> 'source ~/.bashrc; env'`, parsing `DATAMANIFEST_*`) then the deterministic `[_STORAGE._HOST]` overrides then the shared `platformdirs` default — all via the existing `folder_base` ladder. Writes no manifest (bytes only; received object lands as an orphan), integrity is rsync's, idempotent. `$repo`-stored datasets are refused (project-relative, out of scope). |
| `delegation` | ✅ | Cross-language fetch (fetch-ladder rung 3): when a dataset has no native Python fetcher, no `_LANG.shell` fetcher, and no `uri`, and a foreign `[<ds>._LANG.<other>].fetcher` is present, the foreign runtime is invoked to materialize the bytes into the shared store. The Python mechanism runs the local Julia `DataManifest` env directly (`julia --project=<env> -e 'using DataManifest; download_dataset(Database("<abs datasets.toml>"), "<name>")'`) — discovered by walking up from the manifest dir (or `$JULIA_PROJECT`) for a `Project.toml` whose `[deps]` lists `DataManifest`, gated on `shutil.which("julia")`. The subprocess inherits `os.environ`, so `DATAMANIFEST_*` store overrides keep both ends on the same path. On a missing toolchain (no `julia`, or no `Project.toml` depending on `DataManifest`) the rung logs a warning and falls through to `uri`. Fetched datasets only (never `@cached`); on by default and probe-gated; the per-file `delegate` field and the `--delegate` / `--no-delegate` flags toggle it. |

### What differs / is added on top

Behavior in this package beyond — or looser than — the normative spec:

- **v0 read compatibility.** A file with no `[_META]` is read leniently as schema v0
  (flat `python=`, `[_LOADERS]`, …). The spec marks these forms deprecated; this
  package keeps reading them. See [v0 → v1](#v0--v1-read-compatibility-and-migration).
- **`datamanifest migrate`** — opt-in v0→v1→v2 rewrite for Python bindings and `store`
  selectors. Explicitly **non-normative** in the spec (migration is each tool's own
  concern). Running `datamanifest migrate` rewrites bare `store = "x"` entries to
  `store = "$x"` (v1.1 → v2) in addition to the existing v0 → v1 Python-binding
  rewrite.
- **`datamanifest update-checksums`** — recompute stored `sha256` from disk. A local
  convenience, not part of the spec's CLI surface.
- **Legacy read-only location probe.** When a dataset isn't in any configured store,
  this package also probes the pre-v1.1 default `~/.cache/Datasets` (read-only, never
  written, silent). A back-compat affordance on top of the spec's read
  resolution, suppressed once `DATAMANIFEST_DATA_DIR` is set.
- **Built-in loader set.** The spec only requires "the tool's built-in default loader
  for `<format>`"; the concrete Python format→library map is
  [documented below](#built-in-default-loaders).

See [Design notes](design-notes.md) for the proposed produced-dataset identity /
scope / conflict-detection model and the full list of recently-shipped deviations
(pickle default, `scope` field, scope auto-discovery, cache-hit self-heal, …),
written for the spec to reformulate cross-language.

## Python-specific behavior

### Reference resolution (`importlib`)

A `module:function` binding (e.g. `mypkg.fetch:fetch_mydata`) is resolved with
`importlib` — never executed as inline code. The manifest's directory (the project
root) is placed on `sys.path` so a local module alongside `datasets.toml` is
importable without installation. The v0 `python_includes=` field is therefore
obsolete and ignored.

### Built-in default loaders

The load ladder is, in order: (1) the dataset's own loader — explicit
`[<ds>._LANG.python].loader`, else the bare `loader`; (2) the manifest
format-default — `[_LANG.python.loaders][format]`, else the language-implicit
bare `[_LOADERS][format]` map; (3) the built-in loader for the format. (The
explicit `_LANG.python` rung always wins over the bare counterpart at the same
level, and a *present* rung — bare or explicit — that fails to resolve/run is an
error, fail-loud, not a fall-through (spec-v3.6); the ladder only advances past an
*absent* rung.) When a dataset's
`format` reaches rung 3, Python uses a built-in loader. The
format → implementation map (in `datamanifest/default_loaders.py`):

| `format` | Loader | Dependency |
|---|---|---|
| `csv` | `pandas.read_csv(comment="#")` | pandas |
| `parquet` | `pandas.read_parquet` | pandas |
| `nc` | `xarray.open_dataset` | xarray + netcdf4 |
| `dimstack` | `xarray.open_dataset` (no Python `DimStack` type; `xarray.Dataset` is the equivalent) | xarray + netcdf4 |
| `json` | `json.load` | stdlib |
| `toml` | `tomllib.load` | stdlib (`tomli` on 3.10) |
| `yaml` / `yml` | `yaml.safe_load` | pyyaml |
| `md` / `txt` | `open().read()` | stdlib |
| `pickle` / `pkl` | `pickle.load` | stdlib |
| `zip` / `tar` / `tar.gz` | archive extraction loaders | stdlib |

Each third-party dependency is imported lazily, so the package installs without
pandas/xarray/pyyaml and only errors (with an install hint) when such a loader is
actually invoked.

### Produce-or-load cache layer

The produce-or-load feature is an **in-repo layer** (no `[cache]` extra). The code is
organised in three layers with a one-way import arrow — the substrate is consumed by
both feature layers, and neither feature layer imports the other:

```
datamanifest.store   (Layer 0 substrate)  — location resolution, safe-materialize, loaders, canonical sort
        ▲ consumes                 ▲ consumes
datamanifest.database/pipelines    datamanifest.cache
   (Layer 1a: fetch)                  (Layer 1b: @cached) — imports store only, never the fetch layer
```

`@cached` (`from datamanifest.cache import cached`) wraps a **keyword-only** producing
function: its keyword arguments (minus `_`-prefixed runtime knobs) form the key table,
which is hashed (canonical JSON → SHA-256) into a `<hash>` key. Hash-input values are
strings, ints, bools, finite floats, and lists/dicts of those (`None` and non-finite
floats — `nan`/`inf` — are rejected). The result is materialized
once under `$cache` at `<cache>/cached/<project-id>/<cachetype>/[<version>/]<hash>/`
beside a `config.toml` (re-hashable key table + `[_META]`) and a write-if-absent
`metadata.toml` (provenance + an `[origin].cached_toml` back-pointer); subsequent calls
load and return it. A `cached=False` call argument forces a recompute.

When no `format=` is given, the artifact self-saves with **pickle** (`data.pickle`),
so a bare return value (`return 42`) round-trips without choosing a format; an explicit
`format=` (`txt`, `json`, `nc`, …) overrides it. A hit additionally requires the data
file for that format to be present, so two recipes that share a `cachetype` and hash to
the same key recompute rather than misread each other's bytes.

`cachetype` is **optional**: it defaults to the producing function's fully-qualified
importable name (`module.qualname`), so distinct functions never collide; an explicit
value overrides (and `@cached` is usable bare). A function in `__main__` resolves via
`python -m pkg.mod` (→ `pkg.mod.func`, sharing the cache with `import pkg.mod`); a loose
script / `-c` / REPL / notebook has no importable identity and **requires** an explicit
`cachetype=`. At decoration time the recipe is indexed in-process (no disk writes) and
**conflict-checked**: two distinct live functions claiming the same `(cachetype, version)`
raise `CacheTypeConflict` (same cachetype, different version → allowed). The `<scope>`
(ownership) is resolved by the ladder `@cached(scope=…)` (highest) →
`DATAMANIFEST_SCOPE_CACHED` → `[_STORAGE._SCOPE].cached` → the project's
`pyproject.toml` `[project].name` (discovered by walking up for a `datasets.toml` /
`pyproject.toml`, else a path hash). The **same** resolved value drives both the on-disk
path and the `cached.toml` `scope` field, so they cannot diverge (a mismatch would break
scope-aware reachability). `scope="shared"` dedups across projects; `scope=""` is one
global store. See the [design notes](design-notes.md) for the full model.

An optional `version=` string (e.g. `@cached(cachetype="t", version="v2")`) inserts a
path segment before `<hash>` and is recorded in `config.toml` and `cached.toml`. It is
**not** part of the param hash, so changing only `version=` produces a distinct artifact
path without invalidating the hash for callers with other versions. A per-call `cache_dir=`
argument bypasses folder/prefix/scope and uses the supplied directory verbatim.

Each produce registers the artifact in a sibling **`cached.toml`** (gitignored per-machine
state by default). The index is **schema 2 (nested)**: one `[[produced]]` recipe table per
`(scope, cachetype, version)` carrying `ref`/`format`/`store`, with one `[[produced.instances]]`
per produced **variation** recording its parameter `hash` and the `params` (the key table)
that produced it. Calling a recipe with different parameters **accumulates** instances (every
variation stays referenced — none is a false orphan); recipe-level `ref` is refreshed across
refactors. Schema 1 (a flat table per name with a single `hash`) is still read. The registry
is **self-healing**: if `cached.toml` is deleted by hand (or never written), the next cache
*hit* re-registers the on-disk variation, so the index rebuilds itself simply by re-running —
this is the one write a hit may perform (it still never re-stamps `metadata.toml`).
**`datamanifest list`** is the maintenance command: `--kind cached`
selects produced artifacts; `--orphan` flags those with no `cached.toml` root reference;
`--older-than AGE` filters by last-access time. `--delete` / `--move DIR` act on the
selected set (dry run by default; `--yes` to apply). The `list` command is the composition
root — the only place that imports both the fetch and cache layers. It never touches
`$data`/`$repo`, and identifies produced artifacts by their `config.toml` sidecar (so
fetched `$cache` datasets are never selected by `--kind cached`).

`last-access` is read-time-derived: at inspect time the tool `stat`s the artifact and
reports `st_atime` (falling back to mtime, or *unknown* when the path can't be stat-ed).
Reads **never write** — no `utime`, and no sidecar/index TOML is rewritten on read; a
`@cached` hit bumps atime only because the OS does so when it opens the data file. The
signal is coarse (atime is daily-granular under `relatime`, tracks mtime under `noatime`,
and may be absent on network/read-only mounts), so it is advisory — a filter input, never a
deletion authority. `created` (written once at produce time) answers most staleness
questions on its own.

### Canonical serialization

This Python implementation is the **normative reference** for canonical key
ordering: `Database.write()` sorts every dict key by Unicode code point at every
nesting level, with no
`_META`/`_LOADERS`-first special case. The sort lives in the Layer 0 substrate
(`sort_recursive` in `datamanifest.store`); `Database.write()`, the `cached.toml`
index, and `datamanifest format` all share that single normative
implementation. Output is byte-identical to Julia's
`TOML.print(sorted=true)`. The same helper backs `datamanifest format`, which
peer tools pipe their output through to obtain byte-identical files.

### v0 → v1 read compatibility and migration

Only the **inline-code** language-named flat fields are legacy; the bare
per-dataset `fetcher`/`loader`, the bare `shell`, and the top-level `[_LOADERS]`
map are **supported** spec-v3.4/v3.5 forms and are read (and written) as-is, not
deprecated. What `datamanifest migrate <file>` rewrites:

| field on read | what `migrate` does |
|---|---|
| `python=` / `callable=` (per dataset) | promote → `[<ds>._LANG.python] fetcher =` |
| legacy `[<ds>._LANG.shell].fetcher` | **demote → bare `shell`** (canonical, spec-v3.5); empty `_LANG.shell` block dropped |
| bare `shell` / `fetcher` / `loader` | left bare (supported form, no rewrite) |
| `[_LOADERS]` format→binding map | left as a bare `[_LOADERS]` map (supported, spec-v3.4) |
| `python_includes=` | — (project root auto-added to `sys.path`) |

`migrate` promotes only the inline-code `python=`/`callable=` fields, demotes the
legacy `_LANG.shell.fetcher` to bare `shell`, and bumps `[_META].schema = 1`;
bare `fetcher`/`loader` and `[_LOADERS]` are left bare. Migration is a
Python-only convenience — the Julia tool reads these forms but does not rewrite
them.

### CLI

The package ships a `datamanifest` CLI (`list`, `download`, `path`, `add`,
`remove`, `show`, `verify`, `update-checksums`, `init`, `where`, `migrate`,
`format`). `list` doubles as the inspect/maintenance command via `--delete`/`--move`
flags. See the [README](../README.md) or `datamanifest <command> --help`.
